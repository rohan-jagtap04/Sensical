# Sensical

When was the last time you wrote something down. Not for school, a project, or work -- just for yourself. Just to journal.

Social media has pushed us to bandwagon on other's opinion. Causing us to be unable to developa sense of person. Unable to express our values due to fear of what others may think or how others may perceive us.

Now what if you tossed a platform that is completely anonymous and allowed strangers all over the world to debate about random topics. We believe that would spark otherworldy ideas and opinions to explore. We want to push the limits of the 'societal norm' to explore as many perspectives as possible about as many topics as we can.

From education to which side of a twix bar tastes better, we want to invite anyone with an opinion to contribute to our global conversation.

Welcome to Sensical.
